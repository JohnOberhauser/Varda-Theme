To import, go to Preferences -> Browse Packages
Go up one directory, and enter Installed Packages
Extract the package here.
Back in sublime, click preferences -> color scheme and choose Varda
go to preferences -> theme and choose Varda.sublime-theme

Note: The package meta data json file has been renamed with a .bak extensions.  This makes it so sublime doesn't auto delete it when restarted.
