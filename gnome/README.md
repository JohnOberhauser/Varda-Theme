If using the pamac status tray indicator, you must disable and re-enable the extension after changing the theme for the icon to be themed properly.

Icons are a mix of
Flatery

Archdroid from this theme creator
https://github.com/themix-project/oomox

Most of the icons I use I've edited to match my color scheme

The theme is a hacked version of Materia theme

Check the varda branch on my fork for the source

Cursor comes from Breeze Cursor

My fork with the varda theme changes, built from this source

For the cursor to work properly with gtk4 windows, you must also copy to icons folder to /user/local/share/icons/
