Currently too lazy to write a real documentation here, if you have any questions, no matter if it is about `@startpage`, any usage of it here or this project in general, feel free to [write an issue](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage/issues/new) :)

The above shown themes are available as backups in [/themes](./themes). Download the json and import it via the startpage.
