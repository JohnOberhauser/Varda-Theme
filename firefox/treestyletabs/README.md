You must have Tree Style Tab extension installed on Firefox.
Go to Firefox Add-Ons Manager > Tree Style Tab > Options , then click the ballot_box_with_check Unlock Expert Options.
On the Appearance section of the options page, choose the "No Decorations" to disable the built-in theme applied.
Scroll down on the options page until you find the "â–º Advanced" section and expand it. You will see a textfield there with a caption on the top "Extra Style rules provided by Tree Style Tab".
Copy the entire code/content of the treestyletab-edge-mimicry.css and paste it on the textfield.
Close then open the sidebar to restart the tree style tab extension and to be able to load the theme correctly. Alternatively, you can also disable then enable the extension for it to properly load the css codes (and probably to reset the script handling for the pinned tabs, because there seems to be a problem with the pinned tabs layout when in "icons only" mode.)
