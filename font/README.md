Using patched jetbrains font from nerd-fonts
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono

Symbola comes from here https://www.wfonts.com/font/symbola

Move ttf files into ~/.local/share/fonts
In Tweaks, set fonts
Interface: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Regular 11
Document: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Regular 11
Monospace: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Regular 10
Legacy: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Regular 11

Symbola is there so that the system can fall back to using it for unicode characters.  This is necessary for bashtop.

Need to set font specifically for firefox and rofi
