             * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
             * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
             *
             * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
             * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
             *
             * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
             * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
             * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
             * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
             * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
             * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
             *
             * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
             * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
             * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
             * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
             *
             * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
             * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
             * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
             * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
             * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
             * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
             *
             * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
             * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
             * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
             * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
             *
             * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
             * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
             * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
             * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
             * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
             * instance.

         * In order to securely transfer secrets to the Sercret Service, a session
         * is established. This session can be established while initializing a
         * #SecretService object by passing the %SECRET_SERVICE_OPEN_SESSION flag

         *
         * To search for items, use the [method`Service`.search] method.
         *
         * Multiple collections can exist in the Secret Service, each of which contains
         * secret items. In order to instantiate [class`Collection]` objects which
         * represent those collections while initializing a #SecretService then pass
         * the %SECRET_SERVICE_LOAD_COLLECTIONS flag to the [func`Service`.get] or
         * [func`Service`.open] functions. In order to establish a session on an already
         * existing #SecretService, use the [method`Service`.load_collections] function.
         * To access the list of collections use [method`Service`.get_collections].

         *
         * These schemas are used for interoperability between various services storing
         * the same types of items.
         *
         * Each schema has a name like `org.gnome.keyring.NetworkPassword`, and defines a
         * set of attributes, and types (string, integer, boolean) for those attributes.
         *
         * Attributes are stored as strings in the Secret Service, and the attribute types
         * simply define standard ways to store integer and boolean values as strings.
         * Attributes are represented in libsecret via a [struct`GLib`.HashTable] with
         * string keys and values. Even for values that defined as an integer or boolean in
         * the schema, the attribute values in the [struct`GLib`.HashTable] are strings.
         * Boolean values are stored as the strings 'true' and 'false'. Integer values are
         * stored in decimal, with a preceding negative sign for negative integers.
         *
         * Schemas are handled entirely on the client side by this library. The name of the
         * schema is automatically stored as an attribute on the item.
         *
         * Normally when looking up passwords only those with matching schema names are
         * returned. If the schema `flags` contain the `SECRET_SCHEMA_DONT_MATCH_NAME` flag,
         * then lookups will not check that the schema name matches that on the item, only
         * the schema's attributes are matched. This is useful when you are looking up
         * items that are not stored by the libsecret library. Other libraries such as
         * libgnome-keyring don't store the schema name.
         *
