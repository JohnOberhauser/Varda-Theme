         * #SoupLogger, and to determine the amount of debugging output.
         *
         * To use #SoupLogger, first create a logger with [ctor`Logger`.new], optionally

         * [method`Logger`.set_response_filter], and [method`Logger`.set_printer], and

         * [method`Session`.add_feature].
         *
         * By default, the debugging output is sent to `stdout`, and looks something

         * ```
         * > POST /unauth HTTP/1.1

         * The `Soup-Debug-Timestamp` line gives the time (as a `time_t`) when the
         * request was sent, or the response fully received.
         *
         * The `Soup-Debug` line gives further debugging information about the
         * [class`Session]`, [class`Message]`, and [class`Gio`.Socket] involved; the hex
         * numbers are the addresses of the objects in question (which may be useful if

         * across the same connection.
         *
         * Currently, the request half of the message is logged just before
         * the first byte of the request gets written to the network (from the
         * [signal`Message:`:starting] signal).
         *
         * The response is logged just after the last byte of the response body is read

         * [signal`Message:`:got-informational] signal), which means that the

         *
         * You would create a #SoupMessage with [ctor`Message`.new] or
         * [ctor`Message`.new_from_uri], set up its fields appropriately, and send it.
         *
         * [property`Message:`status-code] will normally be a [enum`Status]` value, eg,
         * %SOUP_STATUS_OK, though of course it might actually be an unknown status
         * code. [property`Message:`reason-phrase] is the actual text returned from the
         * server, which may or may not correspond to the "standard" description of
         * `status_code`. At any rate, it is almost certainly not localized, and not very
         * descriptive even if it is in the user's language; you should not use
         * [property`Message:`reason-phrase] in user-visible messages. Rather, you should
         * look at [property`Message:`status-code], and determine an end-user-appropriate
         * message based on that and on what you were trying to do.
         *
         * Note that libsoup's terminology here does not quite match the HTTP
         * specification: in RFC 2616, an "HTTP-message" is *either* a Request, *or* a
         * Response. In libsoup, a #SoupMessage combines both the request and the
         * response.

         * #SoupServer provides a basic implementation of an HTTP server. The
         * recommended usage of this server is for internal use, tasks like
         * a mock server for tests, a private service for IPC, etc. It is not
         * recommended to be exposed to untrusted clients as it may be vulnerable
         * to denial of service attacks or other exploits.
         *
         * To begin, create a server using [ctor`Server`.new]. Add at least one
         * handler by calling [method`Server`.add_handler] or
         * [method`Server`.add_early_handler]; the handler will be called to
         * process any requests underneath the path you pass. (If you want all
         * requests to go to the same handler, just pass "/" (or %NULL) for
         * the path.)
         *
         * When a new connection is accepted (or a new request is started on
         * an existing persistent connection), the #SoupServer will emit
         * [signal`Server:`:request-started] and then begin processing the request
         * as described below, but note that once the message is assigned a
         * status-code, then callbacks after that point will be
         * skipped. Note also that it is not defined when the callbacks happen
         * relative to various [class`ServerMessage]` signals.
         *
         * Once the headers have been read, #SoupServer will check if there is
         * a [class`AuthDomain]` `(qv)` covering the Request-URI; if so, and if the
         * message does not contain suitable authorization, then the
         * [class`AuthDomain]` will set a status of %SOUP_STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED on
         * the message.
         *
         * After checking for authorization, #SoupServer will look for "early"
         * handlers (added with [method`Server`.add_early_handler]) matching the
         * Request-URI. If one is found, it will be run; in particular, this
         * can be used to connect to signals to do a streaming read of the
         * request body.
         *
         * (At this point, if the request headers contain `Expect:
         * 100-continue`, and a status code has been set, then
         * #SoupServer will skip the remaining steps and return the response.
         * If the request headers contain `Expect:
         * 100-continue` and no status code has been set,
         * #SoupServer will return a %SOUP_STATUS_CONTINUE status before
         * continuing.)
         *
         * The server will then read in the response body (if present). At
         * this point, if there are no handlers at all defined for the
         * Request-URI, then the server will return %SOUP_STATUS_NOT_FOUND to
         * the client.
         *
         * Otherwise (assuming no previous step assigned a status to the
         * message) any "normal" handlers (added with
         * [method`Server`.add_handler]) for the message's Request-URI will be
         * run.
         *
         * Then, if the path has a WebSocket handler registered (and has
         * not yet been assigned a status), #SoupServer will attempt to
         * validate the WebSocket handshake, filling in the response and
         * setting a status of %SOUP_STATUS_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS or
         * %SOUP_STATUS_BAD_REQUEST accordingly.
         *
         * If the message still has no status code at this point (and has not
         * been paused with [method`ServerMessage`.pause]), then it will be
         * given a status of %SOUP_STATUS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (because at
         * least one handler ran, but returned without assigning a status).
         *
         * Finally, the server will emit [signal`Server:`:request-finished] (or
         * [signal`Server:`:request-aborted] if an I/O error occurred before
         * handling was completed).
         *
         * If you want to handle the special "*" URI (eg, "OPTIONS *"), you
         * must explicitly register a handler for "*"; the default handler
         * will not be used for that case.
         *
         * If you want to process https connections in addition to (or instead
         * of) http connections, you can set the [property`Server:`tls-certificate]
         * property.
         *
         * Once the server is set up, make one or more calls to
         * [method`Server`.listen], [method`Server`.listen_local], or
         * [method`Server`.listen_all] to tell it where to listen for
         * connections. (All ports on a #SoupServer use the same handlers; if
         * you need to handle some ports differently, such as returning
         * different data for http and https, you'll need to create multiple
         * `SoupServer`s, or else check the passed-in URI in the handler
         * function.).

         * information, etc. It also keeps track of various global options
         * and features that you are using.
         *
         * Most applications will only need a single #SoupSession; the primary
         * reason you might need multiple sessions is if you need to have
         * multiple independent authentication contexts. (Eg, you are
         * connecting to a server and authenticating as two different users at
         * different times; the easiest way to ensure that each [class`Message]`
         * is sent with the authentication information you intended is to use
         * one session for the first user, and a second session for the other
         * user.)
         *
         * Additional #SoupSession functionality is provided by
         * [iface`SessionFeature]` objects, which can be added to a session with
         * [method`Session`.add_feature] or [method`Session`.add_feature_by_type]
         * For example, [class`Logger]` provides support for
         * logging HTTP traffic, [class`ContentDecoder]` provides support for
         * compressed response handling, and [class`ContentSniffer]` provides
         * support for HTML5-style response body content sniffing.
         * Additionally, subtypes of [class`Auth]` can be added
         * as features, to add support for additional authentication types.
         *
         * All `SoupSession`s are created with a [class`AuthManager]`, and support
         * for %SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_BASIC and %SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_DIGEST. Additionally,
         * sessions using the plain #SoupSession class (rather than one of its deprecated
         * subtypes) have a [class`ContentDecoder]` by default.
         *

         * context at the time of the function call.
