        /**
         * `TrackerSparqlConnection` holds a connection to a RDF triple store.
         *
         * This triple store may be of three types:
         *
         *  - Local to the process, created through [ctor`SparqlConnection`.new].
         *  - A HTTP SPARQL endpoint over the network, created through
         *    [ctor`SparqlConnection`.remote_new]
         *  - A DBus SPARQL endpoint owned by another process in the same machine, created
         *    through [ctor`SparqlConnection`.bus_new]
         *
         * When creating a local triple store, it is required to give details about its
         * structure. This is done by passing a location to an ontology, see more
         * on how are [ontologies defined](ontologies.html). A local database may be
         * stored in a filesystem location, or it may reside in memory.
         *
         * A `TrackerSparqlConnection` is private to the calling process, it can be
         * exposed to other hosts/processes via a [class`Endpoint]`, see
         * [ctor`EndpointDBus`.new] and [ctor`EndpointHttp`.new].
         *
         * When issuing SPARQL queries and updates, it is recommended that these are
         * created through [class`SparqlStatement]` to avoid the SPARQL
         * injection class of bugs, see [method`SparqlConnection`.query_statement]
         * and [method`SparqlConnection`.update_statement]. For SPARQL updates
         * it is also possible to use a "builder" approach to generate RDF data, see
         * [class`Resource]`. It is also possible to create [class`SparqlStatement]`
         * objects for SPARQL queries and updates from SPARQL strings embedded in a
         * [struct`Gio`.Resource], see [method`SparqlConnection`.load_statement_from_gresource].
         *
         * To get the best performance, it is recommended that SPARQL updates are clustered
         * through [class`Batch]`.
         *
         * `TrackerSparqlConnection` also offers a number of methods for the simple cases,
         * [method`SparqlConnection`.query] may be used when there is a SPARQL
         * query string directly available, and the [method`SparqlConnection`.update]
         * family of functions may be used for one-off updates. All functions have asynchronous
         * variants.
         *
         * When a SPARQL query is executed, a [class`SparqlCursor]` will be obtained
         * to iterate over the query results.
         *
         * Depending on the ontology definition, `TrackerSparqlConnection` may emit
         * notifications whenever resources of certain types get insert, modified or
         * deleted from the triple store (see [nrl:notify](nrl-ontology.html#nrl:notify).
         * These notifications can be handled via a [class`Notifier]` obtained with
         * [method`SparqlConnection`.create_notifier].
         *
         * After done with a connection, it is recommended to call [method`SparqlConnection`.close]
         * or [method`SparqlConnection`.close_async] explicitly to cleanly close the
         * connection and prevent consistency checks on future runs. The triple store
         * connection will be implicitly closed when the `TrackerSparqlConnection` object
         * is disposed.
         *
         * A `TrackerSparqlConnection` may be used from multiple threads, asynchronous
         * updates are executed sequentially on arrival order, asynchronous
         * queries are dispatched in a thread pool.
         *
         * If you ever have the need to procedurally compose SPARQL query strings, consider
         * the use of [func`sparql_escape_string]` for literal strings and
         * the [func`sparql_escape_uri]` family of functions for URIs.

         * `TrackerSparqlStatement` represents a prepared statement for a SPARQL query.
         *
         * The SPARQL query will be internally compiled into the format that is most
         * optimal to execute the query many times. For connections created
         * through [ctor`SparqlConnection`.new] that will be a
         * SQLite compiled statement.
         *
         * The SPARQL query may contain parameterized variables expressed via the
         * `~` prefix in the SPARQL syntax (e.g. `~var`), these may happen anywhere
         * in the SPARQL where a literal or variable would typically happen. These
         * parameterized variables may be mapped to arbitrary values prior to
         * execution. The `TrackerSparqlStatement` may be reused for future
         * queries with different values.
         *
         * The argument bindings may be changed through the [method`SparqlStatement`.bind_int],
         * [method`SparqlStatement`.bind_int], etc... family of functions. Those functions
         * receive a `name` argument corresponding for the variable name in the SPARQL query
         * (eg. `"var"` for `~var`) and a value to map the variable to.
         *
         * Once all arguments have a value, the query may be executed through
         * [method`SparqlStatement`.execute_async] or [method`SparqlStatement`.execute].
         *
         * It is possible to use any `TrackerSparqlStatement` from other threads than
         * the one it was created from. However, binding values and executing the
         * statement must only happen from one thread at a time. It is possible to reuse
         * the `TrackerSparqlStatement` right after [method`SparqlStatement`.execute_async]
         * was called, there is no need to wait for [method`SparqlStatement`.execute_finish].
         *
         * In some circumstances, it is possible that the query needs to be recompiled
         * from the SPARQL source. This will happen transparently.
