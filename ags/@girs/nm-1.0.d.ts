         *
         * LIBNM_CLIENT_DEBUG is a list of keywords separated by commas. The keyword
         * "trace" enables printing messages of the lowest up to the highest severity.
         * Likewise, the severities "debug", "warn" ("warning") and "error" are honored
         * in similar way. Setting the flags "ERROR" or "WARN" ("WARNING") implies that
         * respective levels are enabled, but also are ERROR messages printed with
         * g_critical() and WARN messages with g_warning(). Together with G_DEBUG="fatal-warnings"
         * or G_DEBUG="fatal-critical" this can be used to abort the program on errors.
         * Note that all &lt;error&gt; messages imply an unexpected data on the D-Bus API
         * (due to a bug). &lt;warn&gt; also implies unexepected data, but that can happen
         * when using different versions of libnm and daemon. For testing, it is
         * good to turn these into assertions.
         *
         * By default, messages are printed to stderr, unless LIBNM_CLIENT_DEBUG
         * contains "stdout" flag. Also, libnm honors LIBNM_CLIENT_DEBUG_FILE
         * environment. If this is set to a filename pattern (accepting "%%p" for the

             * nm_client_new_finish() to get the result.
             *
             * This does nothing beside calling g_async_initable_new_async(). You are free to
             * call g_async_initable_new_async() or g_object_new()/g_async_initable_init_async()
             * directly for more control, to set GObject properties or get access to the NMClient

             * Creating an #NMClient instance can only fail for two reasons. First, if you didn't
             * provide a %NM_CLIENT_DBUS_CONNECTION and the call to g_bus_get()
             * fails. You can avoid that by using g_async_initable_new_async() directly and
             * set a D-Bus connection.
             * Second, if you cancelled the creation. If you do that, then note
             * that after the failure there might still be idle actions pending
             * which keep nm_client_get_main_context() alive. That means,
             * in that case you must continue iterating the context to avoid
             * leaks. See nm_client_get_context_busy_watcher().

             * their (internal) result callback still needs to be dispatched by iterating
             * the client's main context.
             *
             * You thus cannot stop iterating the client's main context until

             * helps to watch how long that will be.
             *
             * This function automates that waiting. Like all glib async operations
             * this honors the current g_main_context_get_thread_default().
             *
             * In any case, to complete the shutdown, nm_client_get_main_context()
             * must be iterated. If the current g_main_context_get_thread_default() is
             * the same as nm_client_get_main_context(), then `integrate_maincontext`
             * is ignored. In that case, the caller is required to iterate the context
             * for shutdown to complete. Otherwise, if g_main_context_get_thread_default()
             * differs from nm_client_get_main_context() and `integrate_maincontext`
             * is %FALSE, the caller must make sure that both contexts are iterated
             * until completion. Otherwise, if `integrate_maincontext` is %TRUE, then
             * nm_client_get_main_context() will be integrated in g_main_context_get_thread_default().
             * This means, the caller gives nm_client_get_main_context() up until the waiting
             * completes, the function will acquire the context and hook it into
             * g_main_context_get_thread_default().
             * It is a bug to request `integrate_maincontext` while having nm_client_get_main_context()
             * acquired or iterated otherwise because a context can only be acquired once
             * at a time.
             *
             * Shutdown can only complete after all references to `client` were released.
             *
             * It is possible to call this function multiple times for the same client.
             * But note that with `integrate_maincontext` the client's context is acquired,
             * which can only be done once at a time.
             *
             * It is permissible to start waiting before the objects is fully initialized.
             *
             * The function really allows two separate things. To get a notification (callback) when
             * shutdown is complete, and to integrate the client's context in another context.
             * The latter case is useful if the client has a separate context and you hand it
             * over to another GMainContext to wrap up.
             *
             * The main use is to have a NMClient and a separate GMainContext on a worker
             * thread. When being done, you can hand over the cleanup of the context
             * to g_main_context_default(), assuming that the main thread iterates
             * the default context. In that case, you don't need to care about passing
             * a callback to know when shutdown completed.
             * @param integrate_maincontext whether to hook the client's maincontext   in the current thread default. Otherwise, you must ensure   that the client's maincontext gets iterated so that it can complete.   By integrating the maincontext in the current thread default, you   may instead only iterate the latter.

             * Implementations may also support cancellation. If `cancellable` is not %NULL,
             * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
             * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
             * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If `cancellable` is not %NULL and
             * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
             * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
             *
             * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
             * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
             * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
             * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
             *
             * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
             * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
             * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
             * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
             * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
             * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
             *
             * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
             * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
             * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
             * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
             *
             * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
             * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
             * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
             * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
             * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
             * instance.
