        /**
         * This base class is for decoders which do not operate on a streaming model.
         * That is: they load the encoded media at once, as part of an initialization,
         * and afterwards can decode samples (sometimes referred to as "rendering the
         * samples").
         *
         * This sets it apart from GstAudioDecoder, which is a base class for
         * streaming audio decoders.
         *
         * The base class is conceptually a mix between decoder and parser. This is
         * unavoidable, since virtually no format that isn't streaming based has a
         * clear distinction between parsing and decoding. As a result, this class
         * also handles seeking.
         *
         * Non-streaming audio formats tend to have some characteristics unknown to
         * more "regular" bitstreams. These include subsongs and looping.
         *
         * Subsongs are a set of songs-within-a-song. An analogy would be a multitrack
         * recording, where each track is its own song. The first subsong is typically
         * the "main" one. Subsongs were popular for video games to enable context-
         * aware music; for example, subsong `#0` would be the "main" song, `#1` would be
         * an alternate song playing when a fight started, `#2` would be heard during
         * conversations etc. The base class is designed to always have at least one
         * subsong. If the subclass doesn't provide any, the base class creates a
         * "pseudo" subsong, which is actually the whole song.
         * Downstream is informed about the subsong using a table of contents (TOC),
         * but only if there are at least 2 subsongs.
         *
         * Looping refers to jumps within the song, typically backwards to the loop
         * start (although bi-directional looping is possible). The loop is defined
         * by a chronological start and end; once the playback position reaches the
         * loop end, it jumps back to the loop start.
         * Depending on the subclass, looping may not be possible at all, or it
         * may only be possible to enable/disable it (that is, either no looping, or
         * an infinite amount of loops), or it may allow for defining a finite number
         * of times the loop is repeated.
         * Looping can affect output in two ways. Either, the playback position is
         * reset to the start of the loop, similar to what happens after a seek event.
         * Or, it is not reset, so the pipeline sees playback steadily moving forwards,
         * the playback position monotonically increasing. However, seeking must
         * always happen within the confines of the defined subsong duration; for
         * example, if a subsong is 2 minutes long, steady playback is at 5 minutes
         * (because infinite looping is enabled), then seeking will still place the
         * position within the 2 minute period.
         * Loop count 0 means no looping. Loop count -1 means infinite looping.
         * Nonzero positive values indicate how often a loop shall occur.
         *
         * If the initial subsong and loop count are set to values the subclass does
         * not support, the subclass has a chance to correct these values.
         * `get_property` then reports the corrected versions.
         *
         * The base class operates as follows:
         * * Unloaded mode
         *   - Initial values are set. If a current subsong has already been
         *     defined (for example over the command line with gst-launch), then
         *     the subsong index is copied over to current_subsong .
         *     Same goes for the num-loops and output-mode properties.
         *     Media is NOT loaded yet.
         *   - Once the sinkpad is activated, the process continues. The sinkpad is
         *     activated in push mode, and the class accumulates the incoming media
         *     data in an adapter inside the sinkpad's chain function until either an
         *     EOS event is received from upstream, or the number of bytes reported
         *     by upstream is reached. Then it loads the media, and starts the decoder
         *     output task.
         *   - If upstream cannot respond to the size query (in bytes) of `load_from_buffer`
         *     fails, an error is reported, and the pipeline stops.
         *   - If there are no errors, `load_from_buffer` is called to load the media. The
         *     subclass must at least call gst_nonstream_audio_decoder_set_output_format()
         *     there, and is free to make use of the initial subsong, output mode, and
         *     position. If the actual output mode or position differs from the initial
         *     value,it must set the initial value to the actual one (for example, if
         *     the actual starting position is always 0, set *initial_position to 0).
         *     If loading is unsuccessful, an error is reported, and the pipeline
         *     stops. Otherwise, the base class calls `get_current_subsong` to retrieve
         *     the actual current subsong, `get_subsong_duration` to report the current
         *     subsong's duration in a duration event and message, and `get_subsong_tags`
         *     to send tags downstream in an event (these functions are optional; if
         *     set to NULL, the associated operation is skipped). Afterwards, the base
         *     class switches to loaded mode, and starts the decoder output task.
         *
         * * Loaded mode</title>
         *   - Inside the decoder output task, the base class repeatedly calls `decode,`
         *     which returns a buffer with decoded, ready-to-play samples. If the
         *     subclass reached the end of playback, `decode` returns FALSE, otherwise
         *     TRUE.
         *   - Upon reaching a loop end, subclass either ignores that, or loops back
         *     to the beginning of the loop. In the latter case, if the output mode is set
         *     to LOOPING, the subclass must call gst_nonstream_audio_decoder_handle_loop()
         *     *after* the playback position moved to the start of the loop. In
         *     STEADY mode, the subclass must *not* call this function.
         *     Since many decoders only provide a callback for when the looping occurs,
         *     and that looping occurs inside the decoding operation itself, the following
         *     mechanism for subclass is suggested: set a flag inside such a callback.
         *     Then, in the next `decode` call, before doing the decoding, check this flag.
         *     If it is set, gst_nonstream_audio_decoder_handle_loop() is called, and the
         *     flag is cleared.
         *     (This function call is necessary in LOOPING mode because it updates the
         *     current segment and makes sure the next buffer that is sent downstream
         *     has its DISCONT flag set.)
         *   - When the current subsong is switched, `set_current_subsong` is called.
         *     If it fails, a warning is reported, and nothing else is done. Otherwise,
         *     it calls `get_subsong_duration` to get the new current subsongs's
         *     duration, `get_subsong_tags` to get its tags, reports a new duration
         *     (i.e. it sends a duration event downstream and generates a duration
         *     message), updates the current segment, and sends the subsong's tags in
         *     an event downstream. (If `set_current_subsong` has been set to NULL by
         *     the subclass, attempts to set a current subsong are ignored; likewise,
         *     if `get_subsong_duration` is NULL, no duration is reported, and if
         *     `get_subsong_tags` is NULL, no tags are sent downstream.)
         *   - When an attempt is made to switch the output mode, it is checked against
         *     the bitmask returned by `get_supported_output_modes`. If the proposed
         *     new output mode is supported, the current segment is updated
         *     (it is open-ended in STEADY mode, and covers the (sub)song length in
         *     LOOPING mode), and the subclass' `set_output_mode` function is called
         *     unless it is set to NULL. Subclasses should reset internal loop counters
         *     in this function.
         *
         * The relationship between (sub)song duration, output mode, and number of loops
         * is defined this way (this is all done by the base class automatically):
         *
         * * Segments have their duration and stop values set to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE in
         *   STEADY mode, and to the duration of the (sub)song in LOOPING mode.
         *
         * * The duration that is returned to a DURATION query is always the duration
         *   of the (sub)song, regardless of number of loops or output mode. The same
         *   goes for DURATION messages and tags.
         *
         * * If the number of loops is >0 or -1, durations of TOC entries are set to
         *   the duration of the respective subsong in LOOPING mode and to G_MAXINT64 in
         *   STEADY mode. If the number of loops is 0, entry durations are set to the
         *   subsong duration regardless of the output mode.
