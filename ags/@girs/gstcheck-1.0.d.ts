         * N.B.: When a unit test waits for a certain amount of clock notifications to
         * be requested in gst_test_clock_wait_for_next_pending_id() or
         * gst_test_clock_wait_for_multiple_pending_ids() then these functions may block
         * for a long time. If they block forever then the expected clock notifications
         * were never requested from #GstTestClock, and so the assumptions in the code
         * of the unit test are wrong. The unit test case runner in gstcheck is
         * expected to catch these cases either by the default test case timeout or the
         * one set for the unit test by calling tcase_set_timeout\(\).
         *
         * The sample code below assumes that the element under test will delay a
         * buffer pushed on the source pad by some latency until it arrives on the sink
         * pad. Moreover it is assumed that the element will at some point call
         * gst_clock_id_wait() to synchronously wait for a specific time. The first
         * buffer sent will arrive exactly on time only delayed by the latency. The
         * second buffer will arrive a little late (7ms) due to simulated jitter in the
         * clock notification.

         * #GstHarness is meant to make writing unit test for GStreamer much easier.
         * It can be thought of as a way of treating a #GstElement as a black box,
         * deterministically feeding it data, and controlling what data it outputs.
         *
         * The basic structure of #GstHarness is two "floating" #GstPads that connect
         * to the harnessed #GstElement src and sink #GstPads like so:
         *
         *
         * ```
         *           __________________________
         *  _____   |  _____            _____  |   _____
         * |     |  | |     |          |     | |  |     |
         * | src |--+-| sink|  Element | src |-+--| sink|
         * |_____|  | |_____|          |_____| |  |_____|
         *          |__________________________|
         *
         * ```
         *
         *
         * With this, you can now simulate any environment the #GstElement might find
         * itself in. By specifying the #GstCaps of the harness #GstPads, using
         * functions like gst_harness_set_src_caps() or gst_harness_set_sink_caps_str(),
         * you can test how the #GstElement interacts with different caps sets.
         *
         * Your harnessed #GstElement can of course also be a bin, and using
         * gst_harness_new_parse() supporting standard gst-launch syntax, you can
         * easily test a whole pipeline instead of just one element.
         *
         * You can then go on to push #GstBuffers and #GstEvents on to the srcpad,
         * using functions like gst_harness_push() and gst_harness_push_event(), and
         * then pull them out to examine them with gst_harness_pull() and
         * gst_harness_pull_event().
         *
         * ## A simple buffer-in buffer-out example
         *
         *
         * ```c
         *   #include <gst/gst.h>
         *   #include <gst/check/gstharness.h>
         *   GstHarness *h;
         *   GstBuffer *in_buf;
         *   GstBuffer *out_buf;
         *
         *   // attach the harness to the src and sink pad of GstQueue
         *   h = gst_harness_new ("queue");
         *
         *   // we must specify a caps before pushing buffers
         *   gst_harness_set_src_caps_str (h, "mycaps");
         *
         *   // create a buffer of size 42
         *   in_buf = gst_harness_create_buffer (h, 42);
         *
         *   // push the buffer into the queue
         *   gst_harness_push (h, in_buf);
         *
         *   // pull the buffer from the queue
         *   out_buf = gst_harness_pull (h);
         *
         *   // validate the buffer in is the same as buffer out
         *   fail_unless (in_buf == out_buf);
         *
         *   // cleanup
         *   gst_buffer_unref (out_buf);
         *   gst_harness_teardown (h);
         *
         *   ```
         *
         *
         * Another main feature of the #GstHarness is its integration with the
         * #GstTestClock. Operating the #GstTestClock can be very challenging, but
         * #GstHarness simplifies some of the most desired actions a lot, like wanting
         * to manually advance the clock while at the same time releasing a #GstClockID
         * that is waiting, with functions like gst_harness_crank_single_clock_wait().
         *
         * #GstHarness also supports sub-harnesses, as a way of generating and
         * validating data. A sub-harness is another #GstHarness that is managed by
         * the "parent" harness, and can either be created by using the standard
         * gst_harness_new type functions directly on the (GstHarness *)->src_harness,
         * or using the much more convenient gst_harness_add_src() or
