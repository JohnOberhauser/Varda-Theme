         * Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making
         * the application get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike
         * most GStreamer elements, Appsink provides external API functions.
         *
         * appsink can be used by linking to the gstappsink.h header file to access the
         * methods or by using the appsink action signals and properties.
         *
         * The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
         * gst_app_sink_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_pull_preroll() methods.
         * These methods block until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the
         * sink is shut down or reaches EOS. There are also timed variants of these
         * methods, gst_app_sink_try_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_try_pull_preroll(),
         * which accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait.
         *
         * Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming
         * thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough, this queue
         * will consume a lot of memory over time. The "max-buffers", "max-time" and "max-bytes"
         * properties can be used to limit the queue size. The "drop" property controls whether the
         * streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum
         * queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively
         * affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
         *
         * If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the "emit-signals" property
         * to %TRUE will make appsink emit the "new-sample" and "new-preroll" signals
         * when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
         *
         * The "caps" property on appsink can be used to control the formats that
         * appsink can receive. This property can contain non-fixed caps, the format of
         * the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps.
         *
         * If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return %NULL, the appsink
         * is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with the
         * "eos" property or with the gst_app_sink_is_eos() method.
         *
         * The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is reached
         * to avoid polling.

        /**
         * The appsrc element can be used by applications to insert data into a
         * GStreamer pipeline. Unlike most GStreamer elements, appsrc provides
         * external API functions.
         *
         * appsrc can be used by linking with the libgstapp library to access the
         * methods directly or by using the appsrc action signals.
         *
         * Before operating appsrc, the caps property must be set to fixed caps
         * describing the format of the data that will be pushed with appsrc. An
         * exception to this is when pushing buffers with unknown caps, in which case no
         * caps should be set. This is typically true of file-like sources that push raw
         * byte buffers. If you don't want to explicitly set the caps, you can use
         * gst_app_src_push_sample. This method gets the caps associated with the
         * sample and sets them on the appsrc replacing any previously set caps (if
         * different from sample's caps).
         *
         * The main way of handing data to the appsrc element is by calling the
         * gst_app_src_push_buffer() method or by emitting the push-buffer action signal.
         * This will put the buffer onto a queue from which appsrc will read from in its
         * streaming thread. It is important to note that data transport will not happen
         * from the thread that performed the push-buffer call.
         *
         * The "max-bytes", "max-buffers" and "max-time" properties control how much
         * data can be queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A
         * filled internal queue will always signal the "enough-data" signal, which
         * signals the application that it should stop pushing data into appsrc. The
         * "block" property will cause appsrc to block the push-buffer method until
         * free data becomes available again.
         *
         * When the internal queue is running out of data, the "need-data" signal is
         * emitted, which signals the application that it should start pushing more data
         * into appsrc.
         *
         * In addition to the "need-data" and "enough-data" signals, appsrc can emit the
         * "seek-data" signal when the "stream-mode" property is set to "seekable" or
         * "random-access". The signal argument will contain the new desired position in
         * the stream expressed in the unit set with the "format" property. After
         * receiving the seek-data signal, the application should push-buffers from the
         * new position.
         *
         * These signals allow the application to operate the appsrc in two different
         * ways:
         *
         * The push mode, in which the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer/push-sample
         * method with a new buffer/sample. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc
         * can be controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
         * stopping/starting the push-buffer/push-sample calls. This is a typical
         * mode of operation for the stream-type "stream" and "seekable". Use this
         * mode when implementing various network protocols or hardware devices.
         *
         * The pull mode, in which the need-data signal triggers the next push-buffer call.
         * This mode is typically used in the "random-access" stream-type. Use this
         * mode for file access or other randomly accessible sources. In this mode, a
         * buffer of exactly the amount of bytes given by the need-data signal should be
         * pushed into appsrc.
         *
         * In all modes, the size property on appsrc should contain the total stream
         * size in bytes. Setting this property is mandatory in the random-access mode.
         * For the stream and seekable modes, setting this property is optional but
         * recommended.
         *
         * When the application has finished pushing data into appsrc, it should call
         * gst_app_src_end_of_stream() or emit the end-of-stream action signal. After
         * this call, no more buffers can be pushed into appsrc until a flushing seek
         * occurs or the state of the appsrc has gone through READY.
