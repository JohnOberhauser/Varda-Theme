             * Pass the `event` that you have in your #GtkWidget::motion-notify-event handler.

             * 3. During a timeout handler, if you want to start a drag after the mouse
             * button is held down for some time.  Try to save the last event that you got
             * from the mouse, using gdk_event_copy(), and pass it to this function
