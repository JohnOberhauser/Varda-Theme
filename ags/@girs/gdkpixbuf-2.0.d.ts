         * A pixel buffer.
         *
         * `GdkPixbuf` contains information about an image's pixel data,
         * its color space, bits per sample, width and height, and the
         * rowstride (the number of bytes between the start of one row
         * and the start of the next).
         *
         * ## Creating new `GdkPixbuf`
         *
         * The most basic way to create a pixbuf is to wrap an existing pixel
         * buffer with a [class`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf] instance. You can use the
         * [`ctor`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf.new_from_data`] function to do this.
         *
         * Every time you create a new `GdkPixbuf` instance for some data, you
         * will need to specify the destroy notification function that will be
         * called when the data buffer needs to be freed; this will happen when
         * a `GdkPixbuf` is finalized by the reference counting functions. If
         * you have a chunk of static data compiled into your application, you
         * can pass in `NULL` as the destroy notification function so that the
         * data will not be freed.
         *
         * The [`ctor`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf.new`] constructor function can be used
         * as a convenience to create a pixbuf with an empty buffer; this is
         * equivalent to allocating a data buffer using `malloc()` and then
         * wrapping it with `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data()`. The `gdk_pixbuf_new()`
         * function will compute an optimal rowstride so that rendering can be
         * performed with an efficient algorithm.
         *
         * As a special case, you can use the [`ctor`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf.new_from_xpm_data`]
         * function to create a pixbuf from inline XPM image data.
         *
         * You can also copy an existing pixbuf with the [method`Pixbuf`.copy]
         * function. This is not the same as just acquiring a reference to
         * the old pixbuf instance: the copy function will actually duplicate
         * the pixel data in memory and create a new [class`Pixbuf]` instance
         * for it.
         *
         * ## Reference counting
         *
         * `GdkPixbuf` structures are reference counted. This means that an
         * application can share a single pixbuf among many parts of the
         * code. When a piece of the program needs to use a pixbuf, it should
         * acquire a reference to it by calling `g_object_ref()`; when it no
         * longer needs the pixbuf, it should release the reference it acquired
         * by calling `g_object_unref()`. The resources associated with a
         * `GdkPixbuf` will be freed when its reference count drops to zero.
         * Newly-created `GdkPixbuf` instances start with a reference count
         * of one.
         *
         * ## Image Data
         *
         * Image data in a pixbuf is stored in memory in an uncompressed,
         * packed format. Rows in the image are stored top to bottom, and
         * in each row pixels are stored from left to right.
         *
         * There may be padding at the end of a row.
         *
         * The "rowstride" value of a pixbuf, as returned by [`method`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf.get_rowstride`],
         * indicates the number of bytes between rows.
         *
         * **NOTE**: If you are copying raw pixbuf data with `memcpy()` note that the
         * last row in the pixbuf may not be as wide as the full rowstride, but rather
         * just as wide as the pixel data needs to be; that is: it is unsafe to do
         * `memcpy (dest, pixels, rowstride * height)` to copy a whole pixbuf. Use
         * [method`GdkPixbuf`.Pixbuf.copy] instead, or compute the width in bytes of the
         * last row as:
         *
         * ```c
         * last_row = width * ((n_channels * bits_per_sample + 7) / 8);
         * ```
         *
         * The same rule applies when iterating over each row of a `GdkPixbuf` pixels
         * array.
         *
         * The following code illustrates a simple `put_pixel()`
         * function for RGB pixbufs with 8 bits per channel with an alpha
         * channel.
         *
         * ```c
         * static void
         * put_pixel (GdkPixbuf *pixbuf,
         *            int x,
         * 	   int y,
         * 	   guchar red,
         * 	   guchar green,
         * 	   guchar blue,
         * 	   guchar alpha)
         * {
         *   int n_channels = gdk_pixbuf_get_n_channels (pixbuf);
         *
         *   // Ensure that the pixbuf is valid

         * ## Loading images
         *
         * The `GdkPixBuf` class provides a simple mechanism for loading
         * an image from a file in synchronous and asynchronous fashion.
         *
         * For GUI applications, it is recommended to use the asynchronous
         * stream API to avoid blocking the control flow of the application.
         *
         * Additionally, `GdkPixbuf` provides the [class`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader`]
         * API for progressive image loading.
         *
         * ## Saving images
         *
         * The `GdkPixbuf` class provides methods for saving image data in
         * a number of file formats. The formatted data can be written to a
         * file or to a memory buffer. `GdkPixbuf` can also call a user-defined
         * callback on the data, which allows to e.g. write the image
         * to a socket or store it in a database.

        /**
         * Incremental image loader.
         *
         * `GdkPixbufLoader` provides a way for applications to drive the
         * process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
         * directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
         * from a file. Applications can use this functionality instead of
         * `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file()` or `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file()`
         * when they need to parse image data in small chunks. For example,
         * it should be used when reading an image from a (potentially) slow
         * network connection, or when loading an extremely large file.
         *
         * To use `GdkPixbufLoader` to load an image, create a new instance,
         * and call [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader.write] to send the data
         * to it. When done, [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader.close] should be
         * called to end the stream and finalize everything.
         *
         * The loader will emit three important signals throughout the process:
         *
         *  - [signal`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader::size-prepared] will be emitted as
         *    soon as the image has enough information to determine the size of
         *    the image to be used. If you want to scale the image while loading
         *    it, you can call [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader.set_size] in
         *    response to this signal.
         *  - [signal`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] will be emitted as
         *    soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been allocated. You can obtain
         *    the `GdkPixbuf` instance by calling [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader.get_pixbuf].
         *    If you want to use it, simply acquire a reference to it. You can
         *    also call `gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf()` later to get the same
         *    pixbuf.
         *  - [signal`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader::area-updated] will be emitted every
         *    time a region is updated. This way you can update a partially
         *    completed image. Note that you do not know anything about the
         *    completeness of an image from the updated area. For example, in an
         *    interlaced image you will need to make several passes before the
         *    image is done loading.
         *
         * ## Loading an animation
         *
         * Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an image. Once the
         * first [signal`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] signal has been
         * emitted, you can call [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufLoader.get_animation] to
         * get the [class`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufAnimation] instance, and then call
         * and [method`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufAnimation.get_iter] to get a
         * [class`GdkPixbuf`.PixbufAnimationIter] to retrieve the pixbuf for the
         * desired time stamp.

         *
         * The `GdkPixbuf` interfaces needed for implementing modules are contained in
         * `gdk-pixbuf-io.h` (and `gdk-pixbuf-animation.h` if the module supports
         * animations). They are not covered by the same stability guarantees as the
         * regular GdkPixbuf API. To underline this fact, they are protected by the
         * `GDK_PIXBUF_ENABLE_BACKEND` pre-processor symbol.
         *
         * Each loadable module must contain a `GdkPixbufModuleFillVtableFunc` function
         * named `fill_vtable`, which will get called when the module
         * is loaded and must set the function pointers of the `GdkPixbufModule`.
         *
         * In order to make format-checking work before actually loading the modules
         * (which may require calling `dlopen` to load image libraries), modules export
         * their signatures (and other information) via the `fill_info` function. An
         * external utility, `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders`, uses this to create a text
         * file containing a list of all available loaders and  their signatures.
         * This file is then read at runtime by `GdkPixbuf` to obtain the list of
         * available loaders and their signatures.
         *
         * Modules may only implement a subset of the functionality available via
         * `GdkPixbufModule`. If a particular functionality is not implemented, the
         * `fill_vtable` function will simply not set the corresponding
         * function pointers of the `GdkPixbufModule` structure. If a module supports
         * incremental loading (i.e. provides `begin_load`, `stop_load` and
         * `load_increment`), it doesn't have to implement `load`, since `GdkPixbuf`
         * can supply a generic `load` implementation wrapping the incremental loading.
         *
         * ## Installing modules
         *
         * Installing a module is a two-step process:
         *
         *  - copy the module file(s) to the loader directory (normally
         *    `$libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/$version/loaders`, unless overridden by the
         *    environment variable `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR`)
         *  - call `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders` to update the module file (normally
         *    `$libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/$version/loaders.cache`, unless overridden
         *    by the environment variable `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE`)

         * The signature prefix for a module.
         *
         * The signature of a module is a set of prefixes. Prefixes are encoded as
         * pairs of ordinary strings, where the second string, called the mask, if
         * not `NULL`, must be of the same length as the first one and may contain
         * ' ', '!', 'x', 'z', and 'n' to indicate bytes that must be matched,
         * not matched, "don't-care"-bytes, zeros and non-zeros, respectively.
         *
         * Each prefix has an associated integer that describes the relevance of
         * the prefix, with 0 meaning a mismatch and 100 a "perfect match".
         *
         * Starting with gdk-pixbuf 2.8, the first byte of the mask may be '*',
         * indicating an unanchored pattern that matches not only at the beginning,
         * but also in the middle. Versions prior to 2.8 will interpret the '*'
         * like an 'x'.
         *
         * The signature of a module is stored as an array of
         * `GdkPixbufModulePatterns`. The array is terminated by a pattern
         * where the `prefix` is `NULL`.
         *
         * ```c
         * GdkPixbufModulePattern *signature[] = {
         *   { "abcdx", " !x z", 100 },
         *   { "bla", NULL,  90 },
         *   { NULL, NULL, 0 }
         * };
         * ```
         *
         * In the example above, the signature matches e.g. "auud\0" with
         * relevance 100, and "blau" with relevance 90.
