        /**
         * This class is for elements that receive buffers in an undesired size.
         * While for example raw video contains one image per buffer, the same is not
         * true for a lot of other formats, especially those that come directly from
         * a file. So if you have undefined buffer sizes and require a specific size,
         * this object is for you.
         *
         * An adapter is created with gst_adapter_new(). It can be freed again with
         * g_object_unref().
         *
         * The theory of operation is like this: All buffers received are put
         * into the adapter using gst_adapter_push() and the data is then read back
         * in chunks of the desired size using gst_adapter_map()/gst_adapter_unmap()
         * and/or gst_adapter_copy(). After the data has been processed, it is freed
         * using gst_adapter_unmap().
         *
         * Other methods such as gst_adapter_take() and gst_adapter_take_buffer()
         * combine gst_adapter_map() and gst_adapter_unmap() in one method and are
         * potentially more convenient for some use cases.
         *
         * For example, a sink pad's chain function that needs to pass data to a library
         * in 512-byte chunks could be implemented like this:
         *
         * ```c
         * static GstFlowReturn
         * sink_pad_chain (GstPad *pad, GstObject *parent, GstBuffer *buffer)
         * {
         *   MyElement *this;
         *   GstAdapter *adapter;
         *   GstFlowReturn ret = GST_FLOW_OK;
         *
         *   this = MY_ELEMENT (parent);
         *
         *   adapter = this->adapter;
         *
         *   // put buffer into adapter
         *   gst_adapter_push (adapter, buffer);
         *
         *   // while we can read out 512 bytes, process them
         *   while (gst_adapter_available (adapter) >= 512 && ret == GST_FLOW_OK) {
         *     const guint8 *data = gst_adapter_map (adapter, 512);
         *     // use flowreturn as an error value
         *     ret = my_library_foo (data);
         *     gst_adapter_unmap (adapter);
         *     gst_adapter_flush (adapter, 512);
         *   }
         *   return ret;
         * }
         * ```
         *
         *
         * For another example, a simple element inside GStreamer that uses #GstAdapter
         * is the libvisual element.
         *
         * An element using #GstAdapter in its sink pad chain function should ensure that
         * when the FLUSH_STOP event is received, that any queued data is cleared using
         * gst_adapter_clear(). Data should also be cleared or processed on EOS and
         * when changing state from %GST_STATE_PAUSED to %GST_STATE_READY.
         *
         * Also check the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DISCONT flag on the buffer. Some elements might
         * need to clear the adapter after a discontinuity.
         *
         * The adapter will keep track of the timestamps of the buffers
         * that were pushed. The last seen timestamp before the current position
         * can be queried with gst_adapter_prev_pts(). This function can
         * optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer that
         * carried the timestamp and the current adapter position. The distance is
         * useful when dealing with, for example, raw audio samples because it allows
         * you to calculate the timestamp of the current adapter position by using the
         * last seen timestamp and the amount of bytes since.  Additionally, the
         * gst_adapter_prev_pts_at_offset() can be used to determine the last
         * seen timestamp at a particular offset in the adapter.
         *
         * The adapter will also keep track of the offset of the buffers
         * (#GST_BUFFER_OFFSET) that were pushed. The last seen offset before the
         * current position can be queried with gst_adapter_prev_offset(). This function
         * can optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer
         * that carried the offset and the current adapter position.
         *
         * Additionally the adapter also keeps track of the PTS, DTS and buffer offset
         * at the last discontinuity, which can be retrieved with
         * gst_adapter_pts_at_discont(), gst_adapter_dts_at_discont() and
         * gst_adapter_offset_at_discont(). The number of bytes that were consumed
         * since then can be queried with gst_adapter_distance_from_discont().
         *
         * A last thing to note is that while #GstAdapter is pretty optimized,
         * merging buffers still might be an operation that requires a `malloc()` and
         * `memcpy()` operation, and these operations are not the fastest. Because of
         * this, some functions like gst_adapter_available_fast() are provided to help
         * speed up such cases should you want to. To avoid repeated memory allocations,
         * gst_adapter_copy() can be used to copy data into a (statically allocated)
         * user provided buffer.
         *
         * #GstAdapter is not MT safe. All operations on an adapter must be serialized by
         * the caller. This is not normally a problem, however, as the normal use case
         * of #GstAdapter is inside one pad's chain function, in which case access is
         * serialized via the pad's STREAM_LOCK.
         *
         * Note that gst_adapter_push() takes ownership of the buffer passed. Use
         * gst_buffer_ref() before pushing it into the adapter if you still want to
         * access the buffer later. The adapter will never modify the data in the
         * buffer pushed in it.

         *  * Installs a #GstPadChainFunction, a #GstPadEventFullFunction and a

         *    #GstAggregatorClass::sink_event and #GstAggregatorClass::sink_query as
         *    needed.
         *
         *  * When data is queued on all pads, the aggregate vmethod is called.

         *    has been taken with pop_buffer (), a new buffer can be queued
         *    on that pad.
         *
         *  * When gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer()
         *    are called, a reference is taken to the returned buffer, which stays

         *      - gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
         *        is guaranteed that the buffer they receive is the same as the peeked
         *        buffer.
         *      - gst_aggregator_pad_drop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
         *        is guaranteed that the dropped buffer is the one that was peeked.
         *      - the subclass implementation of #GstAggregatorClass.aggregate returns.
         *
         *    Subsequent calls to gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or
         *    gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer() return / check the same buffer that was
         *    returned / checked, until one of the conditions listed above is met.
         *
         *    Subclasses are only allowed to call these methods from the aggregate
         *    thread.
         *
         *  * If the subclass wishes to push a buffer downstream in its aggregate
         *    implementation, it should do so through the
         *    gst_aggregator_finish_buffer() method. This method will take care
         *    of sending and ordering mandatory events such as stream start, caps
         *    and segment. Buffer lists can also be pushed out with
         *    gst_aggregator_finish_buffer_list().
         *
         *  * Same goes for EOS events, which should not be pushed directly by the
         *    subclass, it should instead return GST_FLOW_EOS in its aggregate
         *    implementation.
         *
         *  * Note that the aggregator logic regarding gap event handling is to turn
         *    these into gap buffers with matching PTS and duration. It will also
         *    flag these buffers with GST_BUFFER_FLAG_GAP and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DROPPABLE
         *    to ease their identification and subsequent processing.
         *    In addition, if the gap event was flagged with GST_GAP_FLAG_MISSING_DATA,
         *    a custom meta is added to the resulting gap buffer (GstAggregatorMissingDataMeta).
         *
         *  * Subclasses must use (a subclass of) #GstAggregatorPad for both their
         *    sink and source pads.

         * This base class is for parser elements that process data and splits it
         * into separate audio/video/whatever frames.
         *
         * It provides for:
         *
         *   * provides one sink pad and one source pad
         *   * handles state changes
         *   * can operate in pull mode or push mode
         *   * handles seeking in both modes
         *   * handles events (SEGMENT/EOS/FLUSH)
         *   * handles queries (POSITION/DURATION/SEEKING/FORMAT/CONVERT)
         *   * handles flushing
         *
         * The purpose of this base class is to provide the basic functionality of
         * a parser and share a lot of rather complex code.
         *
         * # Description of the parsing mechanism:
         *
         * ## Set-up phase
         *
         *  * #GstBaseParse calls #GstBaseParseClass::start to inform subclass
         *    that data processing is about to start now.
         *
         *  * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps to
         *    inform the subclass about incoming sinkpad caps. Subclass could
         *    already set the srcpad caps accordingly, but this might be delayed
         *    until calling gst_base_parse_finish_frame() with a non-queued frame.
         *
         *  * At least at this point subclass needs to tell the #GstBaseParse class
         *    how big data chunks it wants to receive (minimum frame size ). It can
         *    do this with gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size().
         *
         *  * #GstBaseParse class sets up appropriate data passing mode (pull/push)
         *    and starts to process the data.
         *
         * ## Parsing phase
         *
         *  * #GstBaseParse gathers at least min_frame_size bytes of data either
         *    by pulling it from upstream or collecting buffers in an internal
         *    #GstAdapter.
         *
         *  * A buffer of (at least) min_frame_size bytes is passed to subclass
         *    with #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame. Subclass checks the contents
         *    and can optionally return #GST_FLOW_OK along with an amount of data
         *    to be skipped to find a valid frame (which will result in a
         *    subsequent DISCONT).  If, otherwise, the buffer does not hold a
         *    complete frame, #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame can merely return
         *    and will be called again when additional data is available.  In push
         *    mode this amounts to an additional input buffer (thus minimal
         *    additional latency), in pull mode this amounts to some arbitrary
         *    reasonable buffer size increase.
         *
         *    Of course, gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size() could also be used if
         *    a very specific known amount of additional data is required.  If,
         *    however, the buffer holds a complete valid frame, it can pass the
         *    size of this frame to gst_base_parse_finish_frame().
         *
         *    If acting as a converter, it can also merely indicate consumed input
         *    data while simultaneously providing custom output data.  Note that
         *    baseclass performs some processing (such as tracking overall consumed
         *    data rate versus duration) for each finished frame, but other state
         *    is only updated upon each call to #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame
         *    (such as tracking upstream input timestamp).
         *
         *    Subclass is also responsible for setting the buffer metadata
         *    (e.g. buffer timestamp and duration, or keyframe if applicable).
         *    (although the latter can also be done by #GstBaseParse if it is
         *    appropriately configured, see below).  Frame is provided with
         *    timestamp derived from upstream (as much as generally possible),
         *    duration obtained from configuration (see below), and offset
         *    if meaningful (in pull mode).
         *
         *    Note that #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame might receive any small
         *    amount of input data when leftover data is being drained (e.g. at
         *    EOS).
         *
         *  * As part of finish frame processing, just prior to actually pushing
         *    the buffer in question, it is passed to
         *    #GstBaseParseClass::pre_push_frame which gives subclass yet one last
         *    chance to examine buffer metadata, or to send some custom (tag)
         *    events, or to perform custom (segment) filtering.
         *
         *  * During the parsing process #GstBaseParseClass will handle both srcpad
         *    and sinkpad events. They will be passed to subclass if
         *    #GstBaseParseClass::sink_event or #GstBaseParseClass::src_event
         *    implementations have been provided.
         *
         * ## Shutdown phase
         *
         * * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::stop to inform the
         *   subclass that data parsing will be stopped.
         *
         * Subclass is responsible for providing pad template caps for source and
         * sink pads. The pads need to be named "sink" and "src". It also needs to
         * set the fixed caps on srcpad, when the format is ensured (e.g.  when
         * base class calls subclass' #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps function).
         *
         * This base class uses %GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT as a meaning of frames. So,
         * subclass conversion routine needs to know that conversion from
         * %GST_FORMAT_TIME to %GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT must return the
         * frame number that can be found from the given byte position.
         *
         * #GstBaseParse uses subclasses conversion methods also for seeking (or
         * otherwise uses its own default one, see also below).
         *
         * Subclass `start` and `stop` functions will be called to inform the beginning
         * and end of data processing.
         *
         * Things that subclass need to take care of:
         *
         * * Provide pad templates
         * * Fixate the source pad caps when appropriate
         * * Inform base class how big data chunks should be retrieved. This is
         *   done with gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size() function.
         * * Examine data chunks passed to subclass with
         *   #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame and pass proper frame(s) to
         *   gst_base_parse_finish_frame(), and setting src pad caps and timestamps
         *   on frame.
         * * Provide conversion functions
         * * Update the duration information with gst_base_parse_set_duration()
         * * Optionally passthrough using gst_base_parse_set_passthrough()
         * * Configure various baseparse parameters using
         *   gst_base_parse_set_average_bitrate(), gst_base_parse_set_syncable()
         *   and gst_base_parse_set_frame_rate().
         *
         * * In particular, if subclass is unable to determine a duration, but
         *   parsing (or specs) yields a frames per seconds rate, then this can be
         *   provided to #GstBaseParse to enable it to cater for buffer time
         *   metadata (which will be taken from upstream as much as
         *   possible). Internally keeping track of frame durations and respective
         *   sizes that have been pushed provides #GstBaseParse with an estimated
         *   bitrate. A default #GstBaseParseClass::convert (used if not
         *   overridden) will then use these rates to perform obvious conversions.
         *   These rates are also used to update (estimated) duration at regular
         *   frame intervals.

        /**
         * #GstBaseSink is the base class for sink elements in GStreamer, such as
         * xvimagesink or filesink. It is a layer on top of #GstElement that provides a
         * simplified interface to plugin writers. #GstBaseSink handles many details
         * for you, for example: preroll, clock synchronization, state changes,
         * activation in push or pull mode, and queries.
         *
         * In most cases, when writing sink elements, there is no need to implement
         * class methods from #GstElement or to set functions on pads, because the
         * #GstBaseSink infrastructure should be sufficient.
         *
         * #GstBaseSink provides support for exactly one sink pad, which should be
         * named "sink". A sink implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSink) should
         * install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
         *
         * ```c
         * static void
         * my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
         * {
         *   GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
         *
         *   // sinktemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
         *   // %GST_PAD_SINK and name "sink"
         *   gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &sinktemplate);
         *
         *   gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
         *       "Sink name",
         *       "Sink",
         *       "My Sink element",
         *       "The author <my.sink`my`.email>");
         * }
         * ```
         *
         *
         * #GstBaseSink will handle the prerolling correctly. This means that it will
         * return %GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC from a state change to PAUSED until the first
         * buffer arrives in this element. The base class will call the
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll vmethod with this preroll buffer and will then
         * commit the state change to the next asynchronously pending state.
         *
         * When the element is set to PLAYING, #GstBaseSink will synchronise on the
         * clock using the times returned from #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times. If this
         * function returns %GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE for the start time, no synchronisation
         * will be done. Synchronisation can be disabled entirely by setting the object
         * #GstBaseSink:sync property to %FALSE.
         *
         * After synchronisation the virtual method #GstBaseSinkClass::render will be
         * called. Subclasses should minimally implement this method.
         *
         * Subclasses that synchronise on the clock in the #GstBaseSinkClass::render
         * method are supported as well. These classes typically receive a buffer in
         * the render method and can then potentially block on the clock while
         * rendering. A typical example is an audiosink.
         * These subclasses can use gst_base_sink_wait_preroll() to perform the
         * blocking wait.
         *
         * Upon receiving the EOS event in the PLAYING state, #GstBaseSink will wait
         * for the clock to reach the time indicated by the stop time of the last
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times call before posting an EOS message. When the
         * element receives EOS in PAUSED, preroll completes, the event is queued and an
         * EOS message is posted when going to PLAYING.
         *
         * #GstBaseSink will internally use the %GST_EVENT_SEGMENT events to schedule
         * synchronisation and clipping of buffers. Buffers that fall completely outside
         * of the current segment are dropped. Buffers that fall partially in the
         * segment are rendered (and prerolled). Subclasses should do any subbuffer
         * clipping themselves when needed.
         *
         * #GstBaseSink will by default report the current playback position in
         * %GST_FORMAT_TIME based on the current clock time and segment information.
         * If no clock has been set on the element, the query will be forwarded
         * upstream.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called when the subclass
         * should configure itself to process a specific media type.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop virtual methods
         * will be called when resources should be allocated. Any
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll, #GstBaseSinkClass::render and
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called between the
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop calls.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSinkClass::event virtual method will be called when an event is
         * received by #GstBaseSink. Normally this method should only be overridden by
         * very specific elements (such as file sinks) which need to handle the
         * newsegment event specially.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSinkClass::unlock method is called when the elements should
         * unblock any blocking operations they perform in the
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::render method. This is mostly useful when the
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::render method performs a blocking write on a file
         * descriptor, for example.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSink:max-lateness property affects how the sink deals with
         * buffers that arrive too late in the sink. A buffer arrives too late in the
         * sink when the presentation time (as a combination of the last segment, buffer
         * timestamp and element base_time) plus the duration is before the current
         * time of the clock.
         * If the frame is later than max-lateness, the sink will drop the buffer
         * without calling the render method.
         * This feature is disabled if sync is disabled, the
         * #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times method does not return a valid start time or
         * max-lateness is set to -1 (the default).
         * Subclasses can use gst_base_sink_set_max_lateness() to configure the
         * max-lateness value.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSink:qos property will enable the quality-of-service features of
         * the basesink which gather statistics about the real-time performance of the
         * clock synchronisation. For each buffer received in the sink, statistics are
         * gathered and a QOS event is sent upstream with these numbers. This
         * information can then be used by upstream elements to reduce their processing
         * rate, for example.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSink:async property can be used to instruct the sink to never
         * perform an ASYNC state change. This feature is mostly usable when dealing
         * with non-synchronized streams or sparse streams.

         * This is a generic base class for source elements. The following
         * types of sources are supported:
         *
         *   * random access sources like files
         *   * seekable sources
         *   * live sources
         *
         * The source can be configured to operate in any #GstFormat with the
         * gst_base_src_set_format() method. The currently set format determines
         * the format of the internal #GstSegment and any %GST_EVENT_SEGMENT
         * events. The default format for #GstBaseSrc is %GST_FORMAT_BYTES.
         *
         * #GstBaseSrc always supports push mode scheduling. If the following
         * conditions are met, it also supports pull mode scheduling:
         *
         *   * The format is set to %GST_FORMAT_BYTES (default).
         *   * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns %TRUE.
         *
         * If all the conditions are met for operating in pull mode, #GstBaseSrc is
         * automatically seekable in push mode as well. The following conditions must
         * be met to make the element seekable in push mode when the format is not
         * %GST_FORMAT_BYTES:
         *
         * * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns %TRUE.
         * * #GstBaseSrcClass::query can convert all supported seek formats to the
         *   internal format as set with gst_base_src_set_format().
         * * #GstBaseSrcClass::do_seek is implemented, performs the seek and returns
         *    %TRUE.
         *
         * When the element does not meet the requirements to operate in pull mode, the
         * offset and length in the #GstBaseSrcClass::create method should be ignored.
         * It is recommended to subclass #GstPushSrc instead, in this situation. If the
         * element can operate in pull mode but only with specific offsets and
         * lengths, it is allowed to generate an error when the wrong values are passed
         * to the #GstBaseSrcClass::create function.
         *
         * #GstBaseSrc has support for live sources. Live sources are sources that when
         * paused discard data, such as audio or video capture devices. A typical live
         * source also produces data at a fixed rate and thus provides a clock to publish
         * this rate.
         * Use gst_base_src_set_live() to activate the live source mode.
         *
         * A live source does not produce data in the PAUSED state. This means that the
         * #GstBaseSrcClass::create method will not be called in PAUSED but only in
         * PLAYING. To signal the pipeline that the element will not produce data, the
         * return value from the READY to PAUSED state will be
         * %GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL.
         *
         * A typical live source will timestamp the buffers it creates with the
         * current running time of the pipeline. This is one reason why a live source
         * can only produce data in the PLAYING state, when the clock is actually
         * distributed and running.
         *
         * Live sources that synchronize and block on the clock (an audio source, for
         * example) can use gst_base_src_wait_playing() when the
         * #GstBaseSrcClass::create function was interrupted by a state change to
         * PAUSED.
         *
         * The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times method can be used to implement pseudo-live
         * sources. It only makes sense to implement the #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
         * function if the source is a live source. The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
         * function should return timestamps starting from 0, as if it were a non-live
         * source. The base class will make sure that the timestamps are transformed
         * into the current running_time. The base source will then wait for the
         * calculated running_time before pushing out the buffer.
         *
         * For live sources, the base class will by default report a latency of 0.
         * For pseudo live sources, the base class will by default measure the difference
         * between the first buffer timestamp and the start time of get_times and will
         * report this value as the latency.
         * Subclasses should override the query function when this behaviour is not
         * acceptable.
         *
         * There is only support in #GstBaseSrc for exactly one source pad, which
         * should be named "src". A source implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSrc)
         * should install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
         *
         * ```c
         * static void
         * my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
         * {
         *   GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
         *   // srctemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
         *   // %GST_PAD_SRC and name "src"
         *   gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &srctemplate);
         *
         *   gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
         *      "Source name",
         *      "Source",
         *      "My Source element",
         *      "The author <my.sink`my`.email>");
         * }
         * ```
         *
         *
         * ## Controlled shutdown of live sources in applications
         *
         * Applications that record from a live source may want to stop recording
         * in a controlled way, so that the recording is stopped, but the data
         * already in the pipeline is processed to the end (remember that many live
         * sources would go on recording forever otherwise). For that to happen the
         * application needs to make the source stop recording and send an EOS
         * event down the pipeline. The application would then wait for an
         * EOS message posted on the pipeline's bus to know when all data has
         * been processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped.
         *
         * An application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it
         * perform the EOS logic (send EOS event downstream or post a
         * %GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE on the bus). This can typically be done
         * with the gst_element_send_event() function on the element or its parent bin.
         *
         * After the EOS has been sent to the element, the application should wait for
         * an EOS message to be posted on the pipeline's bus. Once this EOS message is
         * received, it may safely shut down the entire pipeline.

         * This base class is for filter elements that process data. Elements
         * that are suitable for implementation using #GstBaseTransform are ones
         * where the size and caps of the output is known entirely from the input
         * caps and buffer sizes. These include elements that directly transform
         * one buffer into another, modify the contents of a buffer in-place, as
         * well as elements that collate multiple input buffers into one output buffer,
         * or that expand one input buffer into multiple output buffers. See below
         * for more concrete use cases.
         *
         * It provides for:
         *
         * * one sinkpad and one srcpad
         * * Possible formats on sink and source pad implemented
         *   with custom transform_caps function. By default uses
         *   same format on sink and source.
         *
         * * Handles state changes
         * * Does flushing
         * * Push mode
         * * Pull mode if the sub-class transform can operate on arbitrary data
         *
         * # Use Cases
         *
         * ## Passthrough mode
         *
         *   * Element has no interest in modifying the buffer. It may want to inspect it,
         *     in which case the element should have a transform_ip function. If there
         *     is no transform_ip function in passthrough mode, the buffer is pushed
         *     intact.
         *
         *   * The #GstBaseTransformClass.passthrough_on_same_caps variable
         *     will automatically set/unset passthrough based on whether the
         *     element negotiates the same caps on both pads.
         *
         *   * #GstBaseTransformClass.passthrough_on_same_caps on an element that
         *     doesn't implement a transform_caps function is useful for elements that
         *     only inspect data (such as level)
         *
         *   * Example elements
         *
         *     * Level
         *     * Videoscale, audioconvert, videoconvert, audioresample in certain modes.
         *
         * ## Modifications in-place - input buffer and output buffer are the same thing.
         *
         * * The element must implement a transform_ip function.
         * * Output buffer size must <= input buffer size
         * * If the always_in_place flag is set, non-writable buffers will be copied
         *   and passed to the transform_ip function, otherwise a new buffer will be
         *   created and the transform function called.
         *
         * * Incoming writable buffers will be passed to the transform_ip function
         *   immediately.
         * * only implementing transform_ip and not transform implies always_in_place = %TRUE
         *
         *   * Example elements:
         *     * Volume
         *     * Audioconvert in certain modes (signed/unsigned conversion)
         *     * videoconvert in certain modes (endianness swapping)
         *
         * ## Modifications only to the caps/metadata of a buffer
         *
         * * The element does not require writable data, but non-writable buffers
         *   should be subbuffered so that the meta-information can be replaced.
         *
         * * Elements wishing to operate in this mode should replace the
         *   prepare_output_buffer method to create subbuffers of the input buffer
         *   and set always_in_place to %TRUE
         *
         * * Example elements
         *   * Capsfilter when setting caps on outgoing buffers that have
         *     none.
         *   * identity when it is going to re-timestamp buffers by
         *     datarate.
         *
         * ## Normal mode
         *   * always_in_place flag is not set, or there is no transform_ip function
         *   * Element will receive an input buffer and output buffer to operate on.
         *   * Output buffer is allocated by calling the prepare_output_buffer function.
         *   * Example elements:
         *     * Videoscale, videoconvert, audioconvert when doing
         *     scaling/conversions
         *
         * ## Special output buffer allocations
         *   * Elements which need to do special allocation of their output buffers
         *     beyond allocating output buffers via the negotiated allocator or
         *     buffer pool should implement the prepare_output_buffer method.
         *
         *   * Example elements:
         *     * efence
         *
         * # Sub-class settable flags on GstBaseTransform
         *
         * * passthrough
         *
         *   * Implies that in the current configuration, the sub-class is not interested in modifying the buffers.
         *   * Elements which are always in passthrough mode whenever the same caps has been negotiated on both pads can set the class variable passthrough_on_same_caps to have this behaviour automatically.
         *
         * * always_in_place
         *   * Determines whether a non-writable buffer will be copied before passing
         *     to the transform_ip function.
         *
         *   * Implied %TRUE if no transform function is implemented.
         *   * Implied %FALSE if ONLY transform function is implemented.
